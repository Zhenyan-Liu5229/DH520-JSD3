        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>About the website</h2>
        <p>This website hosts all the assignments and projects done for DH520:Javascript and D3 class offered at University of Alberta.</p>

        <p>The Interactive Story was a practice to learn and manipulate the DOM tree by JavaScript. It was a group project and I partnered with <a href='http://hucodev.srv.ualberta.ca/pepe' target='_blank'>Carolina Pepe</a> to write all of the contents, including HTML, CSS and Javascript. I want to thank her for her help on CSS and we have put our code for the story <a href='https://github.com/Zhenyan-Liu5229/DH520-JavaScript-and-D3'>here</a>.</p>
        <p>The Data Visualization project was an attempt to learn and utilize D3. I turned to D3 v4 because I found it more intuitive and easier to follow the available tutorials than v5. And thanks to COVID-19, we didn't have to write the accompanying 1500-word essay.</p>
