1. Interactive Story (Finished)  

All the interactive_story.zip files are for this group assignment. The __interactive_story_final.zip__ file contains all the html, css, js and images for the final interactive story. We decided to keep some of the older versions just to keep a record of our progress. 

Currently, the story is ready to play. Both Lina and I have integrated it into our own websites so you can play two versions of it! The contents are the same, the difference is just in the color.
